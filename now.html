            <p>I work at <a href="https://cohere.ai">Cohere</a> bringing NLP to developers.</p>

            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>I've moved to Toronto in Canada, I've been learning to play
                African Drums and have accumulated an insane amount of books and an unnecessary
                amount of board games
            </p>

            <h2>Log</h2>
            <h3>June 2023</h3>
            <p>Reading (slowly) the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://s3.jacobinmag.com/issues/jacobin-abcs.pdf">ABCs of Socialism</a>.
                Nothing particularly new, but it's good to revisit some ideas.<br>
                Also slowly going through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.ca/Magnum-Opus-Seek-shall-find/dp/0998462802">Magnum Opus</a>,
                I love the name and the alchemical concept, and the short it's based on, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDXOioU_OKM">The Maker</a>,
                is something I revisit from time to time, but the book is slightly childish and hard to get into.
            </p>

            <p>Still happy about Toronto's abundance of Corgis.</p>
